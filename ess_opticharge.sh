# Configuration parameters:
# SOC value in [%] up to which the charge from grid to be initiated.
# If good PV production weather is expected, then pre-charge (during off peak tariff time) the battery up to this SOC threshold, only if the current SOC is <= STOP_ON_SOC_GOOD_PV.
# The value must be between [current_MIN_SOC_value - 90]. If the setting is out of this range, it is set to the edge value closer to the setting. This is done due to safety purposes.
STOP_ON_SOC_GOOD_PV="60"
# If bad PV production weather is expected, then pre-charge (during off peak tariff time) the battery up to this SOC threshold, only if the current SOC is <= STOP_ON_SOC_BAD_PV. This is generally greater than STOP_ON_SOC_GOOD_PV.
# The value must be between [current_MIN_SOC_value - 95]. If the setting is out of this range, it is set to the edge value closer to the setting. This is done due to safety purposes.
STOP_ON_SOC_BAD_PV="75"
#
# ESS Scheduled charge ID (0-4), there are 5 schedules in the ESS menu in Victron GX, if not present, the last one (t.e. 4) will be used as default
SCHED_CHARGE_ID="4"
#
# Off peak tarrif hours, typically this is the time interval that we would like the battery to be charged from grid
# Set the start and stop time in 24h format: [hh:mm]
# The GX should have clock correctly set. Calculations are done in accordance with the local time zone clock reading, that are returned back by date command
# It is important to understand that the energy taken from the grid during this period depends directly on the charge current limit (or max capability if no limits) set in the charger configuration or/and in DVCC menu.
# T.e. if you have set 10A charge current limit, you cannot expect more than 500Wh of energy to be fed into the battery (for 48V battery pack) during for one hour charging time slot, so adapt all your values accordingly.
OFF_PEAK_TIME_START="04:00"
OFF_PEAK_TIME_STOP="05:55"
#
# Whether force charging from grid is allowed (optional future functionality)
FORCE_CHARGE="0"

# Weather Forecast settings:
# Location City in which (or within its region) the system is located (ex. Berlin, London, Paris)
# Timezone according to the timezone notation under /usr/share/zoneinfo (ex. 'Europe/Paris'), the full path would be (/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris)
# It is highly advised to change the venusos localtime (system localtime, since the GUI have two time zones - UTC and the customer set one). The default system time is UTC
# This is seen as symlink in /etc/localtime. In order to change it remove the current symlink and create a new one pointing to your zimezone under /usr/share/zoneinfo/....
# ex.)
# rm -f /etc/localtime 
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime
#
#
# The logic is as follows 
# -> if we expect the whole day to be sunny or partly sunny, then then precharge the battery up to the STOP_ON_SOC_GOOD_PV, only if the current SOC is <= STOP_ON_SOC_GOOD_PV.
# -> if the expected weather is not to be sunny enough (not expecting good pv production), then precharge the battery up to the STOP_ON_SOC_BAD_PV, only if the current SOC is <= STOP_ON_SOC_BAD_PV.
# The purpose is to have enough SOC during the early monrning hours when we are still missing PV production or until it is still low in the morning (this is in case of good PV production expectation)
# but at the same time leaving enough room for storage of the the excess PV energey during the day.
# If BAD PV production weather is expected, then we are pre-charging the battery more (up to STOP_ON_SOC_BAD_PV), so we have enough energy stored in the battery (also good in case of power outages).
